# TODO
* Do full UI design before integrating to firebase/supabase, and geo.
    - Use dummy data and timeouts to mock changes to subscribe to.
* Implement group page navigation with expo-router (top bar navigation with map, chat and maybe participants).
* Implement login page (and redirecting to login page if not logged in).
* Figure out if we need those _layout.tsx files.
